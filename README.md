## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom font (Outfit)
- No JS framework used

### What I learned

This project allowed me to practice and reinforce my skills in using Flexbox for centering content and applying mobile-first design principles. I also got comfortable using CSS variables for color management, making it easier to adjust the theme throughout the project.

One of the most valuable learnings was customizing font faces with `@font-face` and ensuring compatibility across browsers. Here's an example of the CSS custom properties that I used in my solution:

```css
:root{
    --light-blue: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
    --regular-blue: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
}

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to focus on adding interactivity with JavaScript and improving the layout techniques for responsive design. I'll also look into refining my CSS to enhance accessibility, such as adding more contrast and testing the color scheme for colorblind accessibility.
